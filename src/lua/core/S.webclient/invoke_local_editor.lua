-- Spits out the magic text that invokes the local editor in the player's client."
-- NAME is a good human-readable name for the local editor to use for this particular piece of text."
-- TEXT is a string or list of strings, the initial body of the text being edited."
-- UPLOAD, a string, is a MOO command that the local editor can use to save the text when the user is done editing.  The local editor is going to send that command on a line by itself, followed by the new text lines, followed by a line containing only `.'.  The UPLOAD command should therefore call $command_utils:read_lines() to get the new text as a list of strings."
